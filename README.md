# Finance-research-project
In an increasingly demanding economic environment, the financial industry has been evolving over the past few decades. And one of the key determinants of option pricing is the measurement of implied volatility, which is the measure of the deviation from the mean of an asset's price movements over a given period. As each asset has a level of risk that correlates with its profitability, implied volatility allows us to evaluate the evolution of this risk over time and thus to determine the future profitability of the security. In addition, throughout this project, we will try to reproduce the results provided by papers [1] and [2], i.e. to estimate financial options and to approximate the implied volatilities. In the second chapter, we will start the application of the methods presented before, using several machine-learning techniques, in particular the artificial neural network "ANN" which is used to accelerate the corresponding numerical methods.
